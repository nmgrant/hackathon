Install this

    $ npm install lib

to replace this

    var fs = require('fs'),
        util = require('util'),
        http = require('http'),
        path = require('path'),
        mymodule = require('./mymodule'),
        mymodule2 = require('./mymodule2'),
        foo = require('./foo');
        
with this

    var lib = require('lib')('mymodule','mymodule2','foo');

### Tell me more.

Node natives as well as the specified modules are added to the `lib` object as enumerable properties and loaded on first use. 

    lib.util.print('Wow!');

There is no performance overhead, no namespace conflicts, and your code stays nice and compact.
